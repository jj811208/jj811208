### Hello, I'm Ryan üëã

I'm a senior front-end engineer at [GSS](https://www.gss.com.tw/en/about/company/), helping with product development decisions, and optimizing workflows to enhance the developer experience.

I have many years of experience in TypeScript software development, and I'm also a [scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/) certified Scrum Master.

However, I am a newbie in open source, and my English is very basic, if you find something wrong with me, please let me know, so I can have a chance to learn!
