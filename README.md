### Hello, I'm Ryan üëã

As a senior front-end engineer, I not only develop software but also assist in product development decisions, optimize workflow, and improve the developer experience.

I have many years of experience in TypeScript software development, and I'm also a [scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/) certified Scrum Master.

However, my English is very basic, if you find something wrong with me, please let me know, so I can have a chance to learn!
